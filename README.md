# Tools
Collection of scripts and various tools useful to development

## No Dock Generation Tool
This tool when run will generate a 90% complete nodock config file for all of the factions in the game.
Place it inside of root FL directory when running and make sure to copy FactionMap.ini with it.
After it is done, remove all the '=' signs from the [ID List] section.

## SolarCntl Conversion Tool
Prototype tool for converting the old pobs to the new format. Pushing it in it's current state because I almost deleted it by accident
and I want a back up.
